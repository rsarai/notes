## The cipher of Mary Queen of Scots
Secret communication achieved by hiding the existence of a message is known as steganography, derived from the Greek words steganos, meaning "covered," and graphein, meaning "to write."

Steganography also includes the practice of writing in invisible ink. As far back as the first century A . D ., Pliny the Elder explained how the "milk" of the tithymalus plant could be used as invisible ink. Although the ink is transparent after drying, gentle heating chars it and turns it brown.

The aim of cryptography is not to hide the existence of a message, but rather to hide its meaning, a process known as encryption. To render a message
unintelligible, it is scrambled according to a particular protocol, which is agreed beforehand between the sender and the intended recipient. The advantage of cryptography is that if the enemy intercepts an encrypted message, the message is unreadable.

Cryptography itself can be divided into two branches, known as _transposition_ and _substitution_.

- Transposition
The letters of the message are simply rearranged, effectively generating an anagram. For very short messages, such as a single word, this method is relatively insecure because there are only a limited number of ways of rearranging a handful of letters. For example, three letters can be arranged in only six different ways, e.g. **cow , cwo , ocw , owc , wco , woc**. However, as the number of letters gradually increases, the number of possible arrangements rapidly explodes, making it impossible to get back to the original message unless the exact scrambling process is known.
