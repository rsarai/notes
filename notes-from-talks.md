# Pseu, Pseu, Pseudio. Pseudonymization in Django.

## What is Pseudonymization
A data de-identification procedure

## Why would you need this
Protect users identities
GDPR

## Personal Data AKA PII - (Personal Identifier Information)
- Full Names
- Home Addresses
- Email
- Telephones

## Data Privacy Techniques

### Most Commons
#### Pseudonymization
Approach for treating personal data so that it can't be used to identify indivial users without the use of additional information. (Replacing names)
#### Anonymization
Permanent de -identification of a data set so no party will be able to identify the indiduals.

### Pseudonymization Tecniques
- Data Masking
- Approximation (birth date, not save full date)
- Encryption
- Tokenization

## Simple Implementation
### Masking
- User with name field
- Creates a pseudonyms fields like _name, these fields show a masked value
- Update queryset
- Exclude Pseudonyms
- Update admin

### Data masking via custom fields

## API (**A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterfaces)

## Restfull APIs
- Stateles
- HTTP methods
- Url endpoint
- Json x Xml

## Django + DRF

## HTTP HyperText Transfer Protocol
- client <-> server
- CRUD
- Codes

### HTTP Anatomy
- Start/Status line
- Header
- Body

## Rest API Endpoint
- BasicAuthentication
- SessionAuthentication
- TokenAuthentication
- RemoteUserAuthentication

## Json Web Tokens

## GDPR
### Terms
    - Any information realting to an identified or identifiable natural person.
### Rights
    - Company must provide you the data they have about you.
    - Transparency, access, rectification, erasure (delete user on backup?), data portability, restriction of processing
### Tasks
    - By design and default: taking into the account the state of the art, the cost of implementation. (secure applications)
        - Separate personal data completely
        - Separate sensitive data
        - Encrypt sensitive data
        - Restrict access
    - Erase

# The Hardest Scaling Challenge of All
[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86fqsVWngHI)

## Scale
- To climb, ascend;
- To progress in a graduated series;
- To be a gravity defying;

## Outline
- Communication
- Prioritization & Time management
- Delegation
- Personal Development


# Communicating and documenting architectural decisions
[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwfXkSjFhzc)


1. Lightweight Architectural Decision Records
2. Enterprise Architecture Guilds
3. Build Reference Implementations


## Lightweight Architectural Decision Records

> "Why did we decide to do it this way?"

- The decision is not socialized to the team or the organization, resulting in the question above.
- The decision is not recorded, also resulting in the question above, because the team doesn't know what led to that decision.


> Why it's important to document?

- It's great to understand the context of the team/project/code at the moment of the decision.

## ADRs (Architectural Decision Records)

Michael Nygard develop this idea of documenting this decisions along with the code in a lightweight manner.

_(Here David talks "bad" about wikis to prove that putting the documentation on the code is a good idea)_

ARDs are:
- Text document, usually markdown.
- One ADR per file.
- Should be short and straigth to the point.
- Filename named like django migrations
- Saved in a ADR folder at the top level
- ARDs have a status: accepted, deprecated
- ARDs have a context
- ARDs have a decision
- ARDS have consequences: migrations needed, things that this decision don't support, short time consequences, benefits.
- Should be short and to the point

ADRs == Awesome _(David's point)_
Good way to store decisions
Approved by: TW Technology Radar

## Enterprise Architecture Guilds
Complex decisions when a team needs to get together to define a complex architecture.
- Writting ADRs
- Creating the teams (SIGs?)
- Running the team

The team acts as a Architecture Review Board. This team helped with the problem of socializing decisions.

_(This seems to be only applicable for big projects.)_

## Build Reference Implementations
Reference application baked in best practices. _(Seems like vinta's boilerplate)_

# Automating Code Quality: Next Level
_Kyle Knapp_
[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKAaNaVpJFM&feature=youtu.be)

## How to Automate
- Checks
  - flake8
  - pylint
  - coverage
- Run on CI and CodeCov
- Trigger or not PR

## Benefits
- Enforces quality
- Improves efficiency
- Protect developers from mistakes

## Lesser-know tools
- pydocstyle
- doc8
- mypy

### mypy
Static Type check
Helps better document code and catch bugs

### pylint
Static code analysis tools
    - Check coding standards
    - Warns for stylng issues
    - Checks for potential bugs
    - Allows the creation of plugins

## Documentation tools
### pydocstyle
