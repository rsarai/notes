    "### Origins of Service-Oriented Architecture\n",
    "People often mention Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) when they are trying to explain\n",
    "what microservices are.\n",
    "\n",
    ">SOA predates microservices, and its core principle is the idea that you organize applications into a discrete unit of functionality that can be accessed remotely and acted upon and updated independently. \n",
    "- Wikipedia\n",
    "\n",
    "Each unit in this preceding definition is a self-contained service, which implements one facet of a business, and provides its feature through some interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOA services could communicate via Inter-Process Communication (IPC) using sockets on the same machine, through shared memory, through indirect message queues, or even with Remote Procedure Calls (RPC).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The following points summarize the pros and cons of the monolithic approach:\n",
    "- Starting a project as a monolith is easy, and probably the best approach.\n",
    "- A centralized database simplifies the design and organization of the data.\n",
    "- Deploying one application is simple.\n",
    "- Any change in the code can impact unrelated features. When something breaks, the whole application may break.\n",
    "- Solutions to scale your application are limited: you can deploy several instances, but if one particular feature inside the app takes all the resources, it impacts everything.\n",
    "- As the code base grows, it's hard to keep it clean and under control.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are, of course, some ways to avoid some of the issues described here. The obvious solution is to split the application into separate pieces, even if the resulting code is still going to run in a single process. Developers do this by building their apps with external libraries and frameworks. Those tools can be in-house or from the **Open Source Software (OSS)** community.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a web app in Python if you use a framework like Flask, lets you focus on the business logic, and makes it very appealing to externalize some of your code into Flask extensions and small Python packages. And splitting your code into small packages is often a good idea to control your application growth.\n",

    "This loose coupling improves the overall project velocity a lot, as we apply, at the service level, a philosophy similar to the _single responsibility_ principle. The single responsibility principle was defined by Robert Martin to explain that a class\n",
    "should have **only one reason to change**; in other words, each class should provide a **single, well-defined feature**. Applied to microservices, it means that we want to make sure that\n",

    "more complicated, and sometimes, slower. Building that feature in a separate application avoids this problem, and makes it easier to write it with whatever tools you want. You can refactor it often, shorten your release cycles, and stay on top of things. The growth of the application remains under your control.

But you can't run thousands of them, and as soon as the pool is exhausted, the next request will block the client's access even if your microservice is doing nothing but idling and waiting for backend services' responses. That's one of the reasons why non-WSGI frameworks like Twisted and Tornado, and in JavaScript land, Node.js, became very successful--it's fully async.\n",
